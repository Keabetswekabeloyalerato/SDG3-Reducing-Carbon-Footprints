        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Single-use plastics, or disposable plastics, are used only once before they are thrown away or recycled. These items are commonly used for packaging and include items such as plastic bags, straws, coffee stirrers, and water bottles. Single-use plastics have a significant impact on the environment, contributing to pollution, harming wildlife, and filling up landfills and oceans.</p>
        <p>It's important to reduce single-use plastics to minimize their negative effects on the planet. By making small changes to our daily habits and choices, we can collectively make a big difference.</p>
